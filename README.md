# SkinCare Advisor 

Welcome! In this project, I created a code to help users form a skincare routinue based on their skin issues. 

Description: I implemented this using Python and SQL. I chose Python because it's flexible and it is common to use for interacting with databases. I also included SQL because it allows for me to create and store query databases for the skincare products/routinues. I chose the sqlite3 library due to its compatibality with python and it allows me to execute the SQL qeueries to interact with my data. 

I absolutely love skincare and I always recommend for everybody to have one! Prevention is the key. Therefore, I wanted to connect two of my hobbies together(coding + skincare) to create a simple project!
